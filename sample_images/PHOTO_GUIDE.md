|---------|----------|
| No floor plan generated | Make sure floor is visible in photos |
| Distorted 3D model | Avoid wide-angle lens distortion |
| Inaccurate dimensions | Adjust the "assumed room width" setting |
| Incomplete reconstruction | Add more photos from different angles |

## File Requirements

- **Formats:** JPG, JPEG, PNG, BMP, WEBP
- **Recommended size:** 1000-2000 pixels on longest edge
- **Minimum:** 500x500 pixels
- **Maximum:** No hard limit, but larger = slower processing
